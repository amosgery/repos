    <h1>Arya Stark</h1>
    <p>
        Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark. 
        She is tomboyish, headstrong, feisty, independent, disdains traditional female pursuits, 
        and is often mistaken for a boy. 
        She wields a smallsword named Needle, a gift from her half-brother Jon Snow, 
        and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting by Syrio Forel.
